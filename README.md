- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build apps
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making apps
- 📫 How to reach me: design.ebates@gmail.com
- 😄 Exprience so far with the course: some of the information in the course is not current and this can create confusion
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love coming up with ideas for apps

- Project 1: Light App
•	By following outlined steps I was able to create an app that toggled off/on like a light
•	This app was built using Swift
•	The video did not show how to link the app to GitHub

- Project 2: Apple Pie
•	By following a step-by-step YouTube tutorial I was able to attempt to make a copy of a game called Apple Pie
•	Despite attempting to follow each step there were several errors that occurred
•	The instructor was very helpful in solving the problems
•	The video did not show how to link the app to GitHub
